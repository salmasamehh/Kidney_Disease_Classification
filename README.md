# Problem Statement
Kidney diseases are a significant health concern
worldwide, and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective
treatment. CT scans are commonly used to image the
kidneys, but interpretation can be challenging, timeconsuming, and subjective. There is a need for a reliable
and efficient method to classify CT kidney images, which
can assist radiologists and clinicians in making accurate
diagnoses and treatment decisions.
# Our Goal
The CT kidney classification project is aimed at developing a machine
learning model that can classify CT scan images of the kidneys into
different categories, such as normal or abnormal, or into various types
of kidney diseases based on visual features present in the images.
# Dataset
The dataset was collected from PACS (Picture archiving and communication
system) from different hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh where patients were
already diagnosed with having a kidney tumor, cyst, normal or stone finding.
Our dataset contains 12,446 unique data within it in which the cyst
contains 3,709, normal 5,077, stone 1,377, and tumor 2,283.

# Summary
"Classification of Kidney Disease Images using VGG16". This project utilizes deep learning technology to improve the diagnosis of kidney
diseases. The model was trained using CT datasets related to kidney diseases and
VGG-16 technology to classify kidney disease images.
Moreover, I have deployed the model in an easy-to-use GUI to assist the user in
understanding and interacting with the model.
